# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
# Overview
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. It is used for solving optimization problems by having a group of candidate solutions, called particles, explore the solution space and converge towards the best solution over time.

# Key Concepts

Particle: An individual solution in the swarm, representing a potential candidate for the optimal solution.
Swarm: The collection of particles that work together to find the best solution.
Fitness Function: A function that evaluates how good a solution is. The goal is to maximize or minimize this function.
Velocity: The rate at which a particle changes its position in the search space.
Position: The current location of a particle in the search space.
Personal Best (pBest): The best solution found by an individual particle.
Global Best (gBest): The best solution found by any particle in the swarm.

# How It Works
Initialization: The swarm is initialized with random positions and velocities for each particle.
Evaluation: Each particle's fitness is evaluated using the fitness function.
Update pBest: If the current solution is better than the particle's previous best solution, update the pBest.
Update gBest: If the current solution is better than the global best solution found so far, update the gBest.
Update Velocity and Position: Adjust the velocity and position of each particle based on its pBest and gBest.
Iteration: Repeat the evaluation and update steps until a stopping criterion is met
